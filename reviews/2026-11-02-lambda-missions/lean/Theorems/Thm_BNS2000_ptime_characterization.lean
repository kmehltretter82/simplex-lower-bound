/-- **Characterization of Polynomial-Time Computability by Higher-Type Ramified Affinable Recursion**
(Sections 1 & 5, pp. 18, 26–27):
A numerical function `F : (Fin k → Nat) → Nat` is denoted by a closed `RA`-term `t` of type
`!ι → ⋯ → !ι → ι` if and only if `F` is computable in polynomial time (characterized via the
Bellantoni–Cook safe recursion function algebra `BCFunc k 0` together with a polynomial bound
`p_t` on the normalization complexity of `t (!n₁) ... (!nₖ)`). -/
